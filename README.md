## Introduction

In many applications, especially in gaming and simulations, the need for random numbers is crucial. While there are many sophisticated algorithms available, sometimes a simple and fast solution is all you need. PRNG-A-8 is designed to fill that niche. It is perfect for developers who require quick random number generation without the overhead of complex algorithms.

## Features

- **Speed**: Optimized for fast execution, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand, ideal for beginners.
- **8-bit Output**: Generates random numbers in the range of 0 to 255.
- **Statistical Weakness**: Not suitable for cryptographic purposes, but great for simulations and games.
- **Compact Code**: Minimalistic design allows for easy integration into existing projects.

## Installation

To get started with PRNG-A-8, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/DoomKing21/prng-a-8/releases). After downloading, follow these steps to install:

1. Extract the contents of the downloaded file.
2. Place the PRNG-A-8 files in your project directory.
3. Include the necessary files in your project.

## Usage

Using PRNG-A-8 is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the generator in your code:

```c
#include "prng_a_8.h"

int main() {
    // Initialize the PRNG
    prng_a_8_init();

    // Generate a random number
    uint8_t random_number = prng_a_8_generate();
    
    // Print the random number
    printf("Random Number: %d\n", random_number);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Function Overview

- `prng_a_8_init()`: Initializes the PRNG.
- `prng_a_8_generate()`: Generates and returns an 8-bit random number.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to illustrate how you can use PRNG-A-8 in different scenarios:

### Example 1: Generating Random Numbers for a Game

If you're developing a simple game, you might want to generate random positions for enemies or items. Here's how you can do that:

```c
#include "prng_a_8.h"

void spawn_enemy() {
    prng_a_8_init();
    uint8_t x = prng_a_8_generate();
    uint8_t y = prng_a_8_generate();
    
    printf("Enemy spawned at (%d, %d)\n", x, y);
}
```

### Example 2: Randomized Testing

In testing scenarios, you may want to generate random inputs. Hereâ€™s how you can use PRNG-A-8 for that:

```c
#include "prng_a_8.h"

void test_random_numbers() {
    prng_a_8_init();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        uint8_t random_number = prng_a_8_generate();
        printf("Test Random Number %d: %d\n", i + 1, random_number);
    }
}
```
